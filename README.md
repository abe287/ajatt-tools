## Description
AJATT (All Japanese All The Time) is a language learning method that requires massive amounts of content. Gathering content for every week is very time-consuming, which led me to create this tool. The tool helps Japanese language learners download audio, video, and manga for immersion.

When you want to download audio or video files, click on the audio or video tab on the left sidebar. Once on the page, you should see a paste links button on the top right, when clicked a popup will appear where you can paste links to the videos you want to download.

Once you have the links to the video or audio files inserted you can start the download by clicking the download button. Once started you can also stop the download by clicking the stop button. All files will be downloaded to the folders specified on the settings page. To locate a specific file you can click on the folder icon, this will bring up the file explorer with the desired file selected.
